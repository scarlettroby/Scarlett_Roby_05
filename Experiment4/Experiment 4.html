    <h2>Interesting Facts About Time Dilation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Time moves slower for objects moving close to the speed of light compared to those at rest (Special Relativity).</li>
      <li>Gravity can also slow down time — clocks near massive objects run slower (General Relativity).</li>
      <li>Astronauts on long space missions experience time slightly differently than people on Earth.</li>
      <li>GPS satellites have to account for time dilation to provide accurate positioning.</li>
